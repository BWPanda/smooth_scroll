Smooth Scroll
============


Normally, clicking hyperlinks to page anchors causes the browser to jump
immediately to the destination anchor. This module uses JQuery to add a smooth
easing animation instead of this sudden jump.

This module is therefore perfect for "one-page" websites.

By using the Smooth Scroll module the effect is applied to all anchor links
on your Backdrop site.

See example at [http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/)

You can set the speed of the scroll animation at 
`config/user-interface/smooth-scrolling`.

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules
- The default scroll speed is 500ms. Go to `config/user-interface/smooth-scroll`
  if you need to change this.
